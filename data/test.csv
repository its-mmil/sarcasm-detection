I wanted to stock up on office supplies at Tesco but all I could find in the aisle was wine,1
I think women should be able to join men's sports teams and vice versa. I really don't see any problem with for example having a 5 foot 3 inches slim women versus a 300 pound heavyweight boxer because i feel like women are very much equal to any man. Even much faster and stronger men. If anybody takes offense to my point then they need to reevaluate their lives as their are no man that could do anything better than a lady.,1
I am just loving life in Covid times. Long may it last!,1

Everybody loves Christmas! It such a great time to be jolly!,1
So glad boris protected our nhs by having his own Christmas party,1
The omicron variant has decided to give us all a wonderful gift for Christmas. For that one day it has chosen to not be spread between people at all. This gift will make me feel a lot better about being around loved ones who still refuse to get the vaccine or to wear a mask at the very least.   ,1
